    "==================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis of Dataset 1: Student Study Habits & Performance, there is a strong positive \n",
    "correlation between Study_Hours and Test_Score, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.98. \n",
    "This suggests that students who spend more time studying tend to achieve higher test scores. The \n",
    "hypothesis test confirmed this relationship is statistically significant, with a p-value much less \n",
    "than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualizations further support this finding, with the scatter plot clearly showing a linear trend \n",
    "between study hours and test scores. Additionally, the box plot reveals that students with higher \n",
    "attendance rates generally achieve better test scores, with less variability in performance among \n",
    "students with attendance rates above 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For educators and students, these findings emphasize the importance of dedicated study time and \n",
    "regular class attendance as key factors in academic success. Students might benefit from structured \n",
    "study schedules that ensure adequate time is allocated to course material review.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of this analysis is that it does not account for the quality or efficiency of study time, \n",
    "only the quantity. Future research could explore different study techniques and their impact on \n",
    "performance, as well as investigate other factors like prior knowledge, learning styles, or teaching \n",
    "methods that might influence the relationship between study hours and test scores.\n"
